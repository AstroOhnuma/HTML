    <h2>Valve</h2>
    <p>Valve is the company behind Half-Life 2 and many other great games, along with the most popular video game store on the Internet, Steam. Valve overall has a really good track record, creating amazing games in almost every genre, from the puzzle platforming games portal 1 and 2, to the co-op zombie shooters left for dead 1 and 2. Pretty much every game Valve creates is widely renown and almost universally liked. On top of this, with Half-Life 2 came the launch of the Source engine, Valve's open source engine that they used for pretty much every project to follow Half-Life 2. The Source engine is also used to create many games on steam by pretty much any developer due to it being open source.</p>

	<h2>Steam</h2>
    <p>Valve used the launch of Half-Life 2 for many things, most notably however, was the launch of Steam. If you were to buy Half-Life 2 when it came out on PC you would be prompted to make an account for Steam, the launcher used to play Half-Life 2. This was at first met with criticism, but quickly Steam grew into the most popular video game store and launcher on the entire internet. This was not an immediate process and it took time for Steam to become as popular as it is, but nowadays if you want to play games on a computer, you're gonna be using steam. There are many reasons why Steam is so attractive. Not only does it have almost any game you can think of, and many you can't, Steam has constant sales which make buying many games much cheaper. Steam also has a decent modding community in the form of Steam workshop and you can meet many new and interesting people through the steam community.</p>
